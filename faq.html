			<div class="faqs">
			<h1> What platforms to the guitars work on? </h1>
				<p> My guitars are designed to be for multi-purpose. Both PC and Console should work.</p>
			<br>
			<h1> Do all guitars function the same? </h1>
				<p> Yes! They all function the same.</p>
				<br>
			<h1> Do the guitars have tilt for start power? </h1>
				<p> Yes! They function like official guitars.</p>
				<br>
			<h1> Do the guitars have detachable necks? </h1>
				<p> No. Detachable necks on my guitars have a hard time calibrating the buttons and would sometimes lead to unregistered
				button inputs.</p>
				<br>
			<h1> Do you have custom facepaints or custom buttons? </h1>
				<p> Yes.</p>
				<br>
			<h1> How often do you restock? </h1>
				<p> Yes.</p>
				<br>
			<h1> How often do you restock? </h1>
				<p> Yes.</p>
			<br>
			<h1> How often do you restock? </h1>
				<p> Yes.</p>
				<br>
				<h1> Can I pre-order a guitar? </h1>
				<p> Unfortunately, no.</p>
				<br>
				<h1> How do I know if my order went through? </h1>
				<p> You will recieve an order confirmation email from Squarespace. If you are unsuccessful in your 
				purchase but money is withdrawn from your account, those funds will be refunded within 24 hours.</p>
				<br>
				<h1>How much does shipping cost? </h1>
				<p> Shipping is calculated by UPS at checkout based on the weight, box size, and where itâ€™s being shipped to.</p>
				<br>
				<h1> When will you start shipping outside the Philippines? </h1>
				<p> Shipping locally is already hard, and if I were to ship internationally it would take days and maybe even months
				for you to even recieve the guitar.</p>
				<br>
				<h1> Can I send you my own guitar to fix instead of buying a new one? </h1>
				<p> No.</p>
				<br>
				<h1> If I want to buy specific parts from you will you sell them to me? </h1>
				<p> Unless you are an existing customer who has orders atleast once from my shop, no.</p>
				<br>
				<h1> I bought a guitar from you but there is a problem. Where do I contact you? </h1>
				<p>Please refer to the contact page on this website! If you try to contact me on any other platform, 
				I am less likely to see it. I always want to make sure my guitars work exactly as intended.</p>
